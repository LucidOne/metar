08-apr-2005   After receiving a few bug reports and some wishlist items via
              the Debian bug tracking system, I decided to prepare a new
			  version of the package. Most important changes:

			  - metar now defaults to HTTP instead of FTP
			  - download URL is settable via an environment variable
			  - CAVOK and variables winds are now properly decoded

14-dec-2004	  First version of the metar package.
